# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are no official “Long Term Support” versions, instead, fixes to vulnerabilities are made
for the latest feature release and merged up to the main branch.

The Cloud One Community makes no formal guarantee for any older maintenance tracks to receive updates.
In practice, though, critical vulnerability fixes are applied only to the most recent version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability 

The Cloud One Community take all security vulnerabilities seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our open source software.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by creating a request to the Cloud One Community security team [here](https://github.com/trendmicro/cloudone-community/security/advisories/new)

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your request, and will
send a more detailed response indicating the next steps in 
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security
team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and
full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or 
team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
  * These fixes will be released as fast as possible.

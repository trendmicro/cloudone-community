### Contributor Guidelines

Some tips before you start contributing to this project:

- The folder structure convention for this repo is '`/product-name/activity-name/{language}-your-script-foldername`'.

> For example, `/Workload-Security/Migration/bash-hello-migration`

- Recommended to create a README for your folder to make it easier for the community to make use of your script.
- Writing separate test scripts in the `/tests` folder or having a built-in `dry-run` mode in the script to ensure everyone can test your script in their environment is much appreciated :)
- Images and other assets are aÂ welcome addition to your scripts to help everyone run tests / look at examples. Ensure they are stored in relevant folders beside your script, like `/img`, `/assets`, `/examples`, `/tests`. :warning: Avoid including logs with your submission unless it is used as an example. In that case, examples can be included in an `/examples` folder.
- Using language-specific linters is super beneficial for easier code reviews.
- For Python scripts, please consider submitting a `requirements.txt` file within your script folder for easier deployment. You can generate a requirements.txt file using the following command

``` bash
# Install and run in current directory

#  For Python 3:
pip3 install pipreqs
python3 -m  pipreqs.pipreqs .

#  For Python 2:
pip install pipreqs
python -m  pipreqs.pipreqs .

# To check your python version:
python --version
```

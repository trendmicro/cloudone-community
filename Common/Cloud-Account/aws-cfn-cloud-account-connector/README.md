# Add AWS Account to Cloud One

To fully integrate an AWS account in Cloud One, you must deploy resources in your AWS account and do manual steps in Trend Cloud One dashboard. This CloudFormation template automates all these steps on your behalf, including integrating it to Vision One. You can also optionally also deploy Sentry and Network Security with hosted infrastructure to these AWS accounts via this automation.

## What does it actually do?

1. A Custom Resource gets the Cloud One Account ID and Cloud One Region.
2. A Custom Resource completes the integration between the Cloud One and Vision One accounts.
3. All the required IAM resources for Workload Security is created.
4. A Custom Resource completes the integration between the AWS and Workload Security accounts.
5. The default Cloud One CloudFormation stack is deployed.
6. A Custom Resource completes the integration between the AWS and Cloud One accounts.
7. A Custom Resource gets from Cloud One backend the Token for CloudTrail integration.
8. The default CloudTrail CloudFormation stack is deployed.

## Requirements

- Have an API Key for a [Cloud One](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudone) account. Click [here](https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/docs/identity-and-account-management/c1-api-key/#new-api-key) for a guide on how to generate an API Key.
- An AWS Account with Admin permissions
- Generate a Vision One Enrollment Token. See step #1 in [this documentation](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/enterprise/trend-micro-xdr-help/ConfiguringCloudOneWorkloadSecurity).

## Limitations

- Your Stack name must be up 8 characters long or shorter. I recommend `CloudOne`.
- You must deploy the stack to the following region based on your Cloud One account region:

| Cloud One Region  | AWS Region      |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| us-1              | us-east-1       |
| in-1              | ap-south-1      |
| gb-1              | eu-west-2       |
| au-1              | ap-southeast-2  |
| de-1              | eu-central-1    |
| jp-1              | ap-northeast-1  |
| sg-1              | ap-southeast-1  |
| ca-1              | ca-central-1    |

## Parameters

### Required

- CloudOneApiKey
  - Description: Cloud One API Key. See Requirements above for more details.
- VisionOneServiceToken
  - Description: Vision One Service Token. See Requirements above for more details.
- CreateNewTrail:
  - Description: Decides if a new Trail should be created. Defaults to False, so you must enter a S3 Bucket name in the ExistingCloudtrailBucketName parameter. In case you pick True, a new trail and bucket will be created for you. Setting this to True will incur in extra costs.
- ExistingCloudtrailBucketName:
  - Description: Specify the name of an existing bucket that you want to use for forwarding to Trend Micro Cloud One. Only used if CreateNewTrail is set to False.
- DeployCloudSentry:
  - Description: Decides if the Cloud Sentry integration should be deployed. Defaults to True.
- DeployNetworkSecurityIntegration:
  - Description: Decides if the Network Security integration should be deployed. Defaults to True.

### Shouldn't be Changed from Default

These are going to be changed in case you decide to host the templates yourself. `QSS3BucketName` should be the bucket name that you host these templates from and `QSS3KeyPrefix` would be the key prefix/path of the root "folder" for these templates. Example: If the files are hosted in the bucket named `my-bucket` and inside the folder `trendmicro/onboarding`, `QSS3BucketName` value should be `my-bucket` and `QSS3KeyPrefix` value should be `trendmicro/onboarding`.

- QSS3BucketName:
  - Default: cloudone-community
  - Description: S3 bucket name for the deployment assets. Deployment bucket name
    can include numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and hyphens (-).
- QSS3KeyPrefix:
  - Default: ""
  - Description: S3 key prefix for the Deployment assets. Deployment key prefix can include numbers, lowercase letters uppercase letters, hyphens (-), dots(.) and forward slash (/).

## Deployment

### Via Dashboard

[![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=CloudOne&templateURL=https://cloudone-community.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/Common/Cloud-Account/aws-cfn-cloud-account-connector/main.template.yaml)

### Via CLI

You can run the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export BUCKET="your-cloudtrail-bucket"
export APIKEY="your-cloudone-apikey"
export TOKEN="your-visionone-enrollment-token"
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name common-onboard-test --template-url https://cloudone-community.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/Common/Cloud-Account/aws-cfn-cloud-account-connector/main.template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND --parameters ParameterKey=ExistingCloudtrailBucketName,ParameterValue=$BUCKET ParameterKey=CloudOneApiKey,ParameterValue=$APIKEY ParameterKey=VisionOneServiceToken,ParameterValue=$TOKEN ParameterKey=QSS3KeyPrefix,ParameterValue=$HASH/
```

## Removal or Deployment Failure

If one decides to remove this stack, or if it fails during deployment, all modifications made by it, including any kind of account integration, will be reverted back to its pre-deployment state. The only exception is in the Vision One side. The manually created token needs to be deleted manually as well, otherwise the Cloud One account will remain enrolled to the Vision One account.
